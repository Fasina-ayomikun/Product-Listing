# Product Listing Page

## Overview

This project is a simple yet functional product listing page where users can:

- **View Products**: On landing, you can see a list of all products.
- **Filter Products**: Filter through the products using categories and price ranges.
- **View Product Details**: Click on any product to view its details.
- **Edit and Delete Products**: You can edit or delete any product from the list.
- **Persist Data**: All products and changes are saved to `localStorage`, so your updates are preserved even after reloading the page.

## Design

I aimed for a clean and simple design using a single color in different shades to maintain a cohesive look without overwhelming the user. The design might not be highly professional, but it focuses on simplicity and usability. I also included meta tags and ensured that the project name clearly reflects its purpose. While I did create `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files, using them in this small project might not be very impactful.
